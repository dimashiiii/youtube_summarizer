Here are the key notes from the video transcript, including specific measurements and techniques for each of the five mother sauces.

### **Introduction: The Foundation of French Cuisine**
*   **Originator:** Auguste Escoffier, an influential French chef who cooked for royalty.
*   **Significance:** These five sauces are the foundational techniques taught in every Michelin Star kitchen and have heavily influenced modern cuisine.
*   **Escoffier's Contributions:**
    *   Authored a book with over **7,000 recipes**.
    *   Developed the French kitchen brigade system (Chef de Partie, etc.), modeled after the French military.

### **1. Béchamel Sauce**
*   **Core Principle:** A milk-based sauce thickened with a roux. Unlike other mother sauces, it does not use stock.
*   **Key Ingredients & Technique:**
    *   **Roux:** Made with roughly **equal parts butter and flour**. The butter is cooked to a "light nuttiness" before adding the flour. The final roux should resemble "wet sand."
    *   **Milk:** The milk is flavored by warming it with an onion studded with cloves.
    *   **Critical Tip:** **Always add warm milk** to the roux to prevent the sauce from coagulating and becoming lumpy.
    *   **Process:** Add the warm milk gradually while whisking continuously. Cook for about **5 minutes** until the sauce is thick, rich, and glossy.
*   **Consistency Test:** The sauce should "line the back of a spoon," meaning a finger traced through it leaves a clean line.
*   **Variations:**
    *   **Mornay Sauce:** Add cheese (used for lasagna).
    *   **Soubise Sauce:** Blend the béchamel with onions that have been sweated down without color.
    *   **White Sauce:** Remove the onion and add a little nutmeg (traditionally served with Christmas pudding in the UK).

### **2. Velouté Sauce**
*   **Core Principle:** A stock-based sauce thickened with a roux. The name comes from the French word for "velvet."
*   **Key Ingredients & Technique:**
    *   **Roux:** Same ratio as béchamel ("wet sand" consistency) but cooked to a lighter color.
    *   **Stock:** Uses a light-colored stock, like white chicken stock (made from unroasted bones), for a more delicate flavor.
    *   **Process:** Add stock bit by bit to the roux, whisking until it achieves a smooth, velvety texture that coats the back of a spoon.
*   **Variations:**
    *   **Herb Green Sauce (demonstrated):**
        *   Blanch spinach, parsley, and tarragon, then squeeze out all excess water.
        *   Blend the greens into the velouté for about **2 minutes** in a high-powered blender.
        *   Finish with **one tablespoon of mustard**.
    *   **Tip:** Add acidity (like mustard or vinegar) just before serving ("to order") to prevent the green color from fading.

### **3. Espagnole Sauce**
*   **Core Principle:** A rich, brown sauce made from a *mirepoix* (celery, onion, carrot), beef stock, and a brown roux.
*   **Key Ingredients & Technique:**
    *   **Base:** Start by rendering bacon, then add the *mirepoix* to cook in the fat.
    *   **Roux:** Add **about 50g of butter** to the softened vegetables, followed by just under that amount of flour.
    *   **Liquid:** Use a rich beef stock.
    *   **Cooking Time:** Simmer for a long time (shown simmering for **15 minutes**) to cook out the flour taste and allow vegetables to release their sweetness.
    *   **Finishing:** Strain the sauce through a fine sieve.
*   **Variations:**
    *   It's the base for sauces like Demi-glace, Bordelaise, and Diane.
    *   **Duck à l'Orange (demonstrated):** Add the juice of **two oranges** to the finished Espagnole sauce.

### **4. Hollandaise Sauce**
*   **Core Principle:** An emulsion of egg yolks, an acidic liquid (like vinegar), and melted butter.
*   **Key Ingredients & Technique:**
    *   **Base:** Start with egg yolks, vinegar, and a splash of water (**about 100ml**).
    *   **Process:** Whisk continuously over a *bain-marie* (a bowl over simmering water) until the mixture becomes a thick foam called a *sabayon*.
    *   **Temperature:** The mixture should reach about **74°C (165°F)**, the temperature where egg yolks begin to properly coagulate for emulsification.
    *   **Emulsifying:** Slowly whisk in melted butter off the heat. The chef recommends using whole melted butter (including milk solids) for more flavor.
    *   **Tip:** Add salt at the **end**, as adding it earlier can inhibit the sauce from thickening.
*   **Variations:**
    *   **Béarnaise Sauce (quick version demonstrated):** Add finely chopped tarragon and a *brunoise* (very fine dice) of shallot to the finished hollandaise.

### **5. Sauce Tomat (Tomato Sauce)**
*   **Core Principle:** A classic sauce based primarily on tomatoes.
*   **Key Ingredients & Technique:**
    *   **Base:** Sweat down sweet onions (like Roscof) and **one garlic clove** in olive oil until translucent, with no color.
    *   **Tomatoes:** Add chopped tomatoes (the chef uses **about 1 liter** of tinned tomatoes).
    *   **Tip:** Tinned tomatoes are often a good choice as they are harvested and processed at peak ripeness, providing better flavor than out-of-season fresh tomatoes.
    *   **Process:** Cook the sauce down to reduce the water content and concentrate the natural flavors of the tomatoes.
*   **Variations:**
    *   **Romesco Sauce (demonstrated):**
        *   A Spanish variation from Catalonia.
        *   Blend the cooled tomato sauce with roasted red peppers, toasted almonds, garlic, and a splash of vinegar.
        *   Traditionally served with seafood.
