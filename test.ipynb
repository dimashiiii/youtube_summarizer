       "\"As any teacher will tell you, when you’re\\ndealing with certain elements that are being\\nfeisty and fidgety and basically not cooperating,\\nthere’s pretty much only one thing you can\\ndo: you gotta keep ‘em separated.\\nAnd there’s a whole system of biological\\ntissue that’s dedicated to doing just that\\n-- creating order where there would otherwise\\nbe total mayhem.\\nBecause you and pretty much every other animal\\nis made up of incredibly complex, feisty, fidgety\\nsystems that need to be kept apart to some\\nextent if they’re going to get anything done.\\nThink of it this way: Say all the middle-schoolers\\nin your town wanted to have lunch together.\\nAt the same time. On Taco Tuesday.\\nIf you crammed everyone into one giant lunchroom,\\nyou’d have a lot of interesting and talented\\npeople in one place, yes, but you’d also\\nnever get a handle on them with everyone shoved\\nand talking, and jostling, and flirting, and farting, and\\nand stepping on toes, and haggling over tater tots.\\nIt’d be like a John Hughes movie gone horribly\\nwrong.\\nSo what you need is a solid system of organization\\n-- like, separate lunch lines for separate\\ngroups of kids, or tables that arrange students\\nin alphabetical order. Your body is like that\\ncrowded lunchroom -- it needs order for it\\nto function. It can’t have your liver all\\nup in your brain, or squished between your\\nkidneys. Your organs and their systems need\\ntheir personal space.\\nAnd that is where your unsung epithelial tissue\\nsteps in, like a burly gym teacher with a\\nwhistle and plan.\\nThis is the tissue that lines, and covers,\\nand generally organizes your body, creating\\norder from what would be chaos. Without\\nepithelial tissue, you’d essentially be\\na mushy pile of unarticulated goo.\\nWhen we talk about your epithelial tissue\\nwe’re really talking about two things. There’s\\nthe “proper” epithelium, which covers\\nand lines your outer and inner body. And then\\nthere is the glandular epithelium, which forms\\nglands and secretes hormones and other substances.\\nYour primary epithelium protects your whole\\nbody, inside and out. It’s a great organizer,\\npartitioning everything into separate but\\nconnected units. It covers the surface of\\nyour body when it combines with connective\\ntissue to create skin, but it also lines your\\nbody cavities, and coats the internal and\\nexternal walls of many of your organs.\\nBecause, your body doesn’t just interact\\nwith the outside world through your skin.\\nWe -- and all animals from the simplest worms\\non up the Tree of Life -- are really just\\ntubes, corridors of tissue running from a\\nmouth to an anus. Epithelial tissue covers\\nboth the inside and the outside of that you-tube.\\nTo get a better sense of what I mean, take\\na look at this balloon. The latex is like\\nthe outer covering of your body, in part made\\nup of epithelial tissue. It separates what’s\\ninside the balloon from the rest of the world.\\nNow if I stick my hand in there, you can see\\nhow, while the tissue still forms an outer\\nlayer, it also folds in on itself, creating\\na continuous barrier that lines all of the\\ncavities.\\nIn a very similar way, the membranes covering\\nyour lungs for example, are actually invaginations\\nof your epithelium -- where the tissue that\\nmakes up your you-tube folds to form a cavity\\n-- just like this balloon when I push my fingers\\ninto it.\\nThe epithelium does all this to protect your\\ndeeper layers of tissue from injury or infection\\n-- like for example, by lining your stomach\\nwith epithelial cells that produce mucus,\\nso that you don’t digest yourself along\\nwith your lunch.\\nAnd all of your epithelial tissues are avascular\\n-- meaning they don't have a blood supply.\\nInstead they rely on the blood supply in the\\nsupporting connective tissues around them\\nfor the materials they need.\\nBut these tissues come in different varieties\\nthat serve different purposes.\\nAnd a lot of what classifies the different\\ntypes of epithelium boils down to their shape\\nand layering -- that is, the shape of the individual\\ncells, and the number of layers that they form in.\\nAnd there are three basic shapes -- squamous,\\ncuboidal, and columnar -- and they’re pretty\\neasy to tell apart because (unlike most terminology\\nyou’ll be exposed to in this course) their\\nnames actually describe what they look like!\\nSquamous cells are flat. Their name means\\n“scale,” and they look kind of squished,\\nlike fish scales. Even the cell’s nucleus, which gets\\ndarkly stained and is usually easy to see, is flattened.\\nCuboidal cells are -- you guessed it -- cube-ish\\nshaped, about as tall as they are wide. They\\nabsorb nutrients and produce secretions, like\\nsweat. Their nucleus is pretty circular.\\nColumnar cells are tall and thick and look\\nlike columns, and they cushion underlying tissues.\\nAnd as if they were cuboidal cells that got stretched\\ntall, their nuclei also are stretched into an ellipse.\\nAnd here’s yet another instance where the\\nform of a structure relates to it purpose.\\nIn this case, the shape of each kind of epithelial\\ncell correlates with its function.\\nFor example, squamous cells are flat, which\\nmakes it easy for materials like oxygen to\\nmove across them to the other side. So we\\nsee these kinds of cells where absorption\\nor transportation is most important, like in say,\\nthe air sacs of your lungs, or in your blood vessels.\\nBut if the cells that make up a tissue need\\nto, say, brew up hormones or mucus, they’ll\\nneed the internal machinery it takes to make\\nthat stuff, and that takes up a lot of space.\\nSo those cells can’t be flat -- they’ve\\ngot to be cuboidal or columnar to accommodate\\nmore room for taking care of business.\\nSo that stomach lining that I mentioned, for\\nexample, is made up of big columnar cells,\\nbecause they have to make and secrete mucus.\\nBut when it comes to what kind of cells are\\nfound where, an important thing to keep in\\nmind is the fact that cells are, biologically\\nspeaking, expensive -- they take a lot of\\ntime and energy and raw materials to make.\\nSo in places where you lose a lot of cells,\\nlike your outer skin, or in your mouth, you\\nhave more of squamous cells -- because they’re\\nsmaller, and flatter, and therefore cheaper,\\npractically disposable -- rather than big,\\nexpensive cuboidal or columnar ones.\\nWhich brings me to the other trait that we use\\nto classify epithelial tissue -- its layering.\\nA simple epithelium has only one layer of\\ncells.\\nA stratified type has multiple layers set\\non top of each other, like the bricks and\\nmortar of a wall.\\nAnd pseudostratified epithelium is mostly\\njust one layer, but the cells can be different\\nshapes and sizes, and the nuclei can be at\\nlots of different levels, so it looks sort\\nof messy and multilayered, even though it\\nreally isn’t.\\nAnd when we describe a type of epithelial\\ntissue, like in a lab setting, we cite both\\nits shape and its layering. You can think\\nof a tissue’s first name as its number of\\nlayers, and its last name as the shape of\\nits cells.\\nFor example, a simple squamous epithelium\\nrefers to a single layer of flat, scale-like\\ncells, like the lining of the air sacs deep\\nin your lungs.\\nA stratified cuboidal tissue, meanwhile, would\\nhave layers of cube-shaped cells, like the\\nlinings of the ducts that leak sweat and spit.\\nWhen you put the shape of a cell together\\nwith its type of layering, you can begin to\\nsee how both traits inform the function of\\nyour epithelial tissue.\\nLet’s go back to those squamous cells. Because\\nthey’re thin, like scales, it takes many\\nlayers of them to form a tissue that’s thick\\nenough to offer protection. So you end up\\nwith a really dense stack of cells that, on an\\nindividual basis, are small and cheap to make.\\nThat’s why when I, like, scratch my hand\\nor hit the inside of my mouth with a toothbrush,\\nI can lose a couple of layers, no big deal.\\nThose squamous cells are a dime a dozen. There's\\nstill lots of layers left. Plus, epithelial\\ntissue regenerates really quickly.\\nBut if you, say, get tossed off a moving motorcycle,\\nyou’ll lose a lot more layers. And if your\\nroad rash is really bad, you could scrape all\\nthe way through all of those squamous\\ncells, down to the nerves and the blood and\\nall of the underlying connective tissue, plowing\\nthrough a lot more expensive cells, and wind\\nup with a real, like,\\ncan-you-please-get-me-to-the-hospital-I-need-to-get-to-the-hospital kind of problem.\\nOf course, when we talk about epithelial tissue\\nprotecting you, it’s not always protecting\\nyou from the outside world. It also creates\\norder among all of those rambunctious seventh\\ngraders that are your organs. And here it’s\\nimportant to note that all of your epithelial\\ncells are polar, meaning they have distinct\\nsides. The apical or upper side, is exposed\\nto either the outside of your body, or whatever\\ninternal cavity it’s lining. The basal side,\\nor inner surface, is tightly attached to the\\nbasement membrane, a thin layer of mostly\\ncollagen fibers that helps hold the epithelium\\ntogether, and anchors it to the next-deeper\\nlayer -- your connective tissue.\\nMany of these boundaries that the cells form\\naren’t absolute -- instead, they’re selectively\\npermeable, allowing for some level of absorption,\\nfiltration, and excretion of substances.\\nThe tissue lining your small intestines, for\\ninstance, is what allows you to absorb nutrients\\nthrough diffusion and active transport, so\\nthat's pretty important. And all of your urinary\\nwaste gets filtered through a different epithelial\\nlining in your kidneys.\\nSo by now you’re probably starting to get\\nit: Every interaction that your body has with\\nthe rest of the physical universe is made\\npossible somehow by your epithelium.\\nBut that is not all!\\nRemember: Your glands are also made up\\nlargely of epithelial tissue, so it ALSO plays\\na big role in facilitating all of your secretions\\n-- from sweat and mucus, to hormones and enzymes.\\nThis glandular epithelium forms two different\\nkinds of glands -- your endocrine glands,\\nthe ones that secrete hormones right into\\nyour bloodstream or to nearby cells,\\nand your exocrine glands, the type that secrete\\ntheir juices into tubes or ducts that lead\\nto the outside of the body, or the inside\\nof your tube, rather than right into the blood.\\nThe hormone thyroxin, for example, is secreted\\nby an endocrine gland -- your thyroid -- and it\\nneeds to be distributed throughout the entire body so\\nthat it can stimulate the metabolism in all of your cells.\\nSome examples of exocrine secretions would\\nbe sweat, saliva, mucus, stomach acid, and\\nmilk, if you’re lactating.\\nAll those secretions go right into ducts where\\nthey’re ferried to an epithelial surface\\n-- which could be your outer layer of skin,\\nin the case of your sweat, or the edge of\\nyour stomach lining if it’s your stomach\\nacid.\\nSo, hey the system works. And it’s due in\\nlarge part to the humorless gym teacher that\\nis your epithelial tissue.\\nIt may not always be a ton of fun, but darn\\nit, it gets results.\\nToday you learned how your unsung epithelial\\ntissue creates the inner and outer boundaries\\nthat keep you alive. We looked at how proper\\nepithelial tissue is classified by both layering\\n-- simple or stratified -- and shape -- squamous,\\ncuboidal, or columnar -- and how the structure\\nof these tissue types match their function.\\nWe also talked about how epithelial cells\\nare polar, having both apical and basal sides,\\nand are selectively permeable, and lastly\\nwe took a brief look at how our glandular\\nepithelial tissue forms both out endocrine\\nand exocrine glands.\\nThanks for watching, especially to all of\\nour Subbable subscribers, who make Crash Course\\npossible.
